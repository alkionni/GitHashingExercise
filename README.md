## Quiz-4 Hash exercise

The project is a script that receives a 4-digit integer and returns the sha-256 hash of it.

The input:
It should be a unique 4 digit integer.
Could be a command line arguement or a default value.
The default value is 0017 (last 4 digits of my AEM).
Note that there is no check for input, the user is expected to enter a 4 digit integer.
The script will work even if the user input is not a 4-digit integer.

The output:
The script generates a hash_output.txt file which contains the hash value of the unique integer.
The hash_output.txt file is overwritten each time the script is run.
